Snapshots from the simulation created during my Internship with Noblis.


Analysed FAA UAV regulations over Los Angeles with LiDAR flight data from LAX airport.
Displayed the flight traffic compared to current regulation, and showed how the LAX area might be serviced by
the creation of 'Drone Highways'.

Also visualized Monte Carlo simulation of possible flight dynamics when a pilot interacts with a UAV,
and related this to current regulation.

Esentially this was an end-to-end traffic/regulation/interaction simulator and visualizer. 
To be adapted for regulation changes, and help influence decisions in regulation changes.

All data analysis done in R, while engineering of simulation created in Python and Google Earth.
