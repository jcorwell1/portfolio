This project involved creating an AI using dynamic programming.

The attached images are the AI moving about it's current world.
'results.txt' show the cost of movement compared to the minimum cost of movement.
The AI performs about about 90% of minimum cost in each world. This could be imporved by implementing diagnol movements, but that greatly increases risk of collision to obstacles.
